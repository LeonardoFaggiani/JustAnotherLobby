# Just Another Lobby

This is a proof of concept in which a multiplayer game for up to four players was created to apply both basic and advanced concepts handled by Unreal Engine.

The project is developed in C++ and Blueprints in Unreal Engine version 5.1. Additionally, plugins such as `CommonUI` and `AdvancedSteamSessions` were utilized.

If you want to have a better experience, run the game in standalone so that the loading screen works correctly.
